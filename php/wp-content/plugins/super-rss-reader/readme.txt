An awesome RSS widget plugin, which displays feeds like news ticker effect with thumbnails, multiple tabbed feeds, customizable color styles and more

== Description ==

Super RSS Reader is jQuery based RSS reader widget, which displays the RSS feeds in the widget in an attractive way. It uses the jQuery easy ticker plugin to add a news ticker like effect to the RSS feeds. Multiple RSS feeds can be added for a single widget and they get seperated in tabs.

The plugin is fully customizable with external styles and with some inbuilt color styles. It acts as a perfect replacement for the default RSS widget in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I customize the RSS widget externally ? =

You can use the `super-rss-reader-widget` class in your stylesheet to control the widget styling. Other classes are,

1. `srr-tab-wrap` - the tab's class.
1. `srr-wrap` - the wrapper of the widget.
1. `srr-item.odd` - to control the odd feed items.
1. `srr-item.even` - to control the even feed items.

= Will the additional ticker effect slows the site ? =

No. the additional effect needs only 3.4 Kb of additional file. I think thats not too heavy to slow down the site.

= How to create a tabbed mode ? =

Just enter the RSS feed URLs seperated by comma in the widget, the plugin automatically renders the tab.
